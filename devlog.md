To start this project I have set up my Git repository through Github. I've checked the project description and have been thinking about how to divide up the pieces of the project. To start with today I will create the main menu for the project in Python. Each session I will work on another divided piece of the project.

Today I am planning to write a parser class to read the index files. I will also create a heap class to parse the index file into. I will test this separately before integrating with the menu from yesterday. For testing I will use the sample.idx file.
